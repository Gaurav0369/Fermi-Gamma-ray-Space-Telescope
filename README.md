# Problem Statement A

## Introduction 

In the mid-1960s, researchers first discovered pulsars, which emit regular
bursts of radio waves and were initially considered enigmatic. It was later
found that they were rotating neutron stars emitting radiation that was
observed across a broad range of wavelengths, including gamma rays. Since
then, gamma-ray astronomy has continued to be a field of active research, and
a significant fraction of gamma-ray sources remain unidentified. The goal of
this problem statement is to develop a machine learning model that can
accurately classify gamma-ray sources based on their characteristics and
properties, using data from various space-based observatories. Gamma-ray
sources can be broadly classified into two types: AGNs and pulsars. The pulsars
can be further classified as millisecond pulsars or young pulsars. Similarly some
common types of AGNs include quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and blazars.


## Task 1

Train a model to classify different types of Gamma-ray Sources.
We have used a logistic regression model to classify all the sub categories of pulsars and AGNs 


## Task 2

Create a sky map of the classified sources.
Skymap plottted using astropy.


## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Download this google drive folder on your own device. 
2. extract it and run  the notebook on jupyter.

Or
